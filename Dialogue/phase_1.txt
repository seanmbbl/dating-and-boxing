There she is.\nWendy Levinne.\nBeautiful as ever.
I fantasized about her a lot,\nbut this is the first time I've been on a date with her.
My communication skills aren't the best,\nbut hopefully I'll be able to...
<Wendy,1,0,0>
Uh... $...\nwho are you talking to?
<$>
Oh! Wendy!\nI thought I was... uhh...
<Wendy>
You thought you were what?#Daydreaming<11>;Never Mind<16>
<Wendy,1,2,2>
{play_sfx:disgust}
Wow... this "date" is already off to a good start!\nAre you already dozing off?!
<$>
I will be focused on you for the rest of\nthe day, my dear!\nI swear!<18>
<Wendy,0,3,0>
Try not to be distracted by other thoughts\nduring our little date today, okay?
<Wendy,0,0,0>
Maybe we should do something to break the ice.\nTo get to know each other better.
Do you have any hobbies?#Cooking<21>;Sporting<23>;Watching anime<33>
<Wendy,0,0,1>
Huh. Being able to cook well\nis always a plus in my book.<42>
<Wendy,0,1,1>
{play_sfx:hearts}
Really?\nI'm a sporty person too!
<Wendy,3,0,1>
To be precise, I love boxing.\nNothing beats the feeling you get when you're\npunching the other person IN THE FACE!
Hey, why don't you come see me fighting?\nYou'll get a front row seat!
<$>
Really? That sounds great!
<Wendy,2,2,1>
And by "front row seat" I mean you\nget to fight me!\nIN THE RING!<48>
<Wendy,1,5,2>
{play_sfx:disgust}
Ugh... ARE YOU SERIOUS?!\nYou're the 5th person this week who\ngave me that exact answer!
<Narrator>
Note to self:\nPerhaps I should not tell her about my\n12-hour long anime marathon sessions.
<Wendy,0,2,0>
I almost wanted to end the date right here and now,\nbut I'll give you one more chance to talk yourself\nout of this mess.
<$>
Uhhh... okay....\n...what is your hobby..?
<Wendy,0,0,1>
My personal hobby is boxing.\nI may not look very strong, but boxing\nis fighting backed by TECHNIQUE.
It's not the strongest boxer who always wins.\nIt's the one who can exploit the other's weakness first.
In fact, why don't I give you a demonstration?
<Wendy,2,2,1>
And by "demonstration" I mean you get to fight me!\nIN THE RING!
That way, you can make up for\nnot paying attention in the beginning!
<$>
Uuuuhhhhhh...\nSure...?\nQuestion mark...?
<Wendy,3,1,1>
Great! See you at 8pm tonight!\nGood-bye!
<Narrator>
Wow... you really know how to dig yourself\ndeeper and deeper, don't you?
Welp, you don't have much of a choice now.\nIf you want to win her heart,\nyou'll need to face her in the ring.
