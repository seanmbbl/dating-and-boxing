Whew, you're better at boxing\nthan I thought you would be...
<Wendy,2,2,1>
But I was holding back the entire fight.\nYou should see me when I go all out!
<$>
Uh... I think I'll pass on that...
<Wendy,0,0,1>
Perhaps it's better to get know\neach other a little bit better.
Is there something you want to know about me?#School life<10>;Start of boxing<29>;Manga<38>
<$>
How are you doing at school?
<Wendy,0,3,0>
{play_sfx:confusion}
Uh... great..?\nMy grades are all just above\nwhat is needed to pass..?
<Narrator>
Shallow questions are not going to\nbring this relationship to a deeper level...
It would be better to ask her about her favorite...#Subject<18>;Teacher<24>
<Wendy,3,0,1>
My favorite subject is the arts.
Not because I'm very creative, but because\nthere aren't any real test you have to study for.
Just make something decent and you'll pass.
<Wendy,3,3,0>
Though P.E. would be my favorite\nif the teacher let us do boxing...<48>
<Wendy,0,0,0>
Hmmm...\nI guess that would be Mr. Willink.
He's the only teacher I ca listen to\nwithout falling aspleep halfway through.
<Wendy,0,3,0>
Though Mr. Smalls would be my favorite\nif he lets us do boxing during P.E.<48>

Where did your passion for boxing come from?
<Wendy,3,0,1>
{play_sfx:hearts}
My passion started when I was 5 years old.\nI was watching an old boxing match between\nMuhammad Ali and George Foreman.
Foreman was considered one of the heaviest hitters\nin the history of boxing.\nHe was the favorite to win.
And yet, Ali came victorious.\nAll while taunting him during the bout.\nThat moment really moved me.
<Wendy,0,1,1>
Ali became loved by the world by winning that bout,\nand I decided I wanted to be famous too someday.<55>
<$>
Do you like manga?
<Wendy,1,5,2>
{play_sfx:disgust}
...
<Wendy,1,2,2>
Hate it.

Perhaps I should change the subject...#School life<10>;Start of boxing<29>
<$>
You really like boxing a lot, huh?
<Wendy,0,4,1>
{play_sfx:idea}
Say, why don't we step into the ring\nonce more?
<Wendy,2,2,1>
If you do, perhaps you'll understand the beauty\nof boxing like I do.<63>
<$>
I'm sure you're dream will come true\nif you train hard enough.
<Wendy,0,4,1>
{play_sfx:idea}
Speaking of which,\n why don't we step into the ring once more?
<Wendy,2,2,1>
I'll need to train extra hard to become\nthe champion of the world.
And you'll make a good training partner!
<$>
Uh... okay...\nI've fought you before so I don't see\nwhy I wouldn't..?
<Wendy>
Just a heads-up:\nthis bout will not be as easy as the last!
