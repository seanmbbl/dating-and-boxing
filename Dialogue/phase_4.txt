Welp, you've beaten me fair and square.\nI guess we're bound to do this\nevery now and then for some time...
<Wendy,0,4,1>
And if I'm being honest...\nI think I like it this way.
<Wendy,0,0,1>
The fighting keeps my head clear\nof those stupid evasive thoughts.

Perhaps it is better if we do\nsomething a bit more, uhm...\n"date-like" tomorrow.
I mean...\nAll we did up to now is fighting...
<Narrator>
Man, that sounds weird out of context...
<Wendy>
You're right.\nLet's watch a movie together tomorrow!
<Wendy,3,1,1>
I hear there's a sequel\nto the Rocky series in theaters now!
<$>
Oh no... here we go again...
